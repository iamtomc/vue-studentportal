## Description
MyUIC Neo is a Single-Page Application (SPA) and a Progressive Web App (PWA) version of MyUIC, a student portal website by the [University of the Immaculate Conception](https://uic.edu.ph). Not only it improves the user interface and user experience but it also provides additional features that fully utilizes different types of information only few can access prior to it.

Thanks to [CapacitorJS](https://capacitorjs.com), it is also a mobile app providing another set of features that cannot be achieved with just the web app.

## Prerequisites
### Web
- Node 16 or later
- NPM

### Android
> Android compilation is optional but is required if you want to compile it as an Android app.
- Android SDK (30 and above)

### iOS
- Xcode 13 or later
- iDevice or Simulator
- Cocoapod
- CapacitorJS `$ sudo gem install cocoapods`
  - FOR APPLE SILICON MACS ONLY: `$ sudo arch -x86_64 gem install ffi`

## Installation
To run MyUIC Neo on your local computer, simply execute the following commands:

### npm
```
git clone https://github.com/nedpals/myuic-neo.git
cd myuic-neo
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite webserver at http://localhost:3000. You may login by typing `123456789012` as the student ID and `myuicneo` as the password.

#### Run as Android App
> See the [Android](#android) prequisites for requirements on how to build the Android app.

To run the app, simply run:
```
npm run start-android
```

This will build the web app, inject it's contents, and install the app to your simulator or your device.

#### Run as iOS App
> See the [iOS](#ios) prequisites for requirements on how to build the iOS app.

To run the app, simply run:
```
npm run start-ios
```

This will build the web app, inject it's contents, and install the app to your simulator or your device.

## Connecting to the real API
By default, the web server will load the mock server. The mock server is a fake "server" that emulates the real API for development and in order to avoid unnecessary load to the real server when trying out for the first time.

To use the real API, simply create an `.env` file and copy the following:
```
VITE_API_URL=https://pinkschool-api.herokuapp.com
```

Paste the contents to `.env` file and restart the web server.
